 # Library
 Encapsulation:I use private variables like 'title' and 'author' in the 'Book' class. Also, I provide public methods like getTitle() to access these variables. This hides the details of how the book information is stored.

 Polymorphism: was used in 'Library' class so it can store both 'Book' and 'PrintedBook' objects using the same method 'addBook()'.

 Inheritance: 'PrintedBook' class is inherits properties and methods from the Book class. This means 'PrintedBook' automatically gets properties like 'title', 'author', and methods like 'getTitle()' from 'Book'.
